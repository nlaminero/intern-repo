## Introduction

Hi! Thank you for helping me with this usability test.

This session is to observe how a new user interacts with the Focus Bear app. Please remember, we are testing the app, not you. There are no right or wrong answers. Feel free to speak out loud as you go so I can understand your thoughts.

If something feels confusing or unexpected, that’s really useful for me to know. I won’t be helping during the task unless you're fully stuck.

## Test Scenario

You’ve just downloaded the Focus Bear app for the first time.

Your goal is to go through the onboarding process, then **set up your first habit** (for example: “Drink water” or “Stretch for 5 minutes”).

Do whatever feels natural try to complete that task as if you were using the app on your own.

## Tasks

1. Complete the onboarding questions and setup.
2. Add your first habit.
3. explore the app
4. Try to navigate back to the dashboard.

## Follow-Up Questions

After the session, ask:

- What did you expect to happen during onboarding?
- Was it clear how to set up a habit?
- What was easy for you to do?
- What was confusing or frustrating?
- If you could improve one thing, what would it be?

## Notes for the Facilitator

- Let the participant explore without leading them.
- Observe hesitation, backtracking, or moments of confusion.
- Take notes or record (with consent) to document key reactions.
