# Cyber Security Guidelines

## What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
I currently use strong, unique passwords for most accounts and try to avoid clicking on suspicious links. I also keep my laptop locked when I’m away from it and use biometric login on my phone. However, I still use browser-based password storage sometimes, and I want to switch to a proper password manager to improve my security even more.

## How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
By setting up systems that make security automatic. For example, enabling auto-lock on devices, using a password manager so I don’t reuse passwords, and keeping 2FA turned on. Security becomes a habit when the right tools are in place, and I don't have to think about it constantly — it just becomes part of my daily workflow.

## What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- I’ll switch to using a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password.
- I’ll make sure every work account has 2FA enabled.
- I’ll review and update any weak or reused passwords.
- I’ll avoid saving passwords in browsers or shared docs.

## What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
First, I would immediately change the password for the affected account and log out of all devices. Then I would report the issue to the Focus Bear team (e.g., PM or dev team lead) and document what happened. I’d also review login history or use a security scan tool (if available) to check for other suspicious activity.

## ✅ My Cyber Security Task Progress

- [x] Enabled 2FA on my GitHub and Google accounts  
- [x] Set up my computer and phone to auto-lock after 2–3 minutes of inactivity  
- [x] Currently researching password managers and plan to finish setup this week  

### One new cyber security habit I will follow:
**I will start using a password manager to store all my work-related passwords securely instead of reusing or saving them in browser memory.**
