# AI Usage Guidelines – Focus Bear

## What AI tools are typically used for your role?
As a UX designer, I use tools like ChatGPT to help brainstorm design ideas, improve UX copy, summarize research findings, and check grammar in documentation. I’ve also explored Figma plugins powered by AI for content generation and layout suggestions.

## What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?
The benefits include saving time, sparking creativity, and improving communication. However, risks include over-reliance, accepting inaccurate or biased responses, and accidentally leaking sensitive or private information by pasting it into AI chats.

## What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?
Confidential company information, personal user data, internal documents, passwords, or any private project files should never be entered into AI tools—especially those not hosted securely within the company.

## How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?
I review all AI-generated suggestions with a critical mindset. If it involves facts or statistics, I cross-check with a trusted source. If it’s UX copy, I read it aloud, test it with others, and tweak the tone to make sure it aligns with the brand and our neurodivergent users.

## Reflection

### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
I use AI for first drafts, idea generation, or quick formatting help. But when it comes to final UX decisions, user empathy, or product reasoning, I rely on my own knowledge, feedback from real users, and input from the team. AI is a tool, not a replacement for human design thinking.

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
I remind myself that AI outputs are just suggestions — not finished work. I always question the tone, accuracy, and purpose behind any AI response. I also try to use AI as a thinking partner, not a crutch, by comparing its answers to what I’d come up with on my own first.

### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
- Never paste sensitive or internal Focus Bear data into public AI tools.
- Only use general descriptions or fake data if needed.
- Ask permission before using AI to process or summarize anything shared by other teammates.
- Keep AI use transparent with the team (e.g., mentioning when I used it to help draft documentation or design rationale).
