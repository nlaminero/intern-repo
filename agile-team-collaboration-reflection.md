# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration 

## Agile Ceremonies Overview

**Daily Stand-ups**  
Short daily meetings where each team member shares what they worked on, what they’re working on next, and any blockers. Helps everyone stay aligned and accountable.

**Sprint Planning (Scrum)** vs. **Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**  
- Sprint Planning: Tasks are selected and committed for a 1–2 week period. Used in Scrum-based workflows.
- Continuous Prioritization: Tasks are pulled as capacity allows, more flexible and flow-based. Used in Kanban.

**Retrospectives**  
Team reflects on the last sprint or period of work. What went well, what didn’t, and what can be improved.

**Backlog Refinement**  
Team reviews the backlog, clarifies task descriptions, breaks them down if needed, and reorders priorities. Ensures the board stays clean and actionable.

## Reflection

**How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?**  
Agile ceremonies give structure to team communication. In our UX meeting today, our UX lead walked us through current issues and shared three design approaches for onboarding. This helped interns like me understand the “why” behind the design decisions. Tasks were clearly assigned, so we all knew what direction to take — I chose the homepage redesign.

Ceremonies like these ensure everyone is aligned, especially when collaborating asynchronously or across locations.

**Which ceremony is most important for your role, and why?**  
For my role as a UX intern, **Backlog Refinement** is especially important. It helps me understand what design tasks are coming up, the context behind each one, and where I can contribute. It also ensures the work I’m doing matches the overall product goals.

## Task Activities

- ✅ Attended a UX team meeting (similar to a Sprint Planning/Review session)
  - Observed onboarding design issues and 3 proposed solutions
  - Assigned upcoming design tasks for interns
  - Chose “Homepage Redesign” as my focus area

- ✅ Observed how feedback and future planning were handled in a collaborative environment  
  - The team asynchronously updates the GitHub board  
  - Design tasks are tracked and aligned with onboarding goals

## One Change I Can Make to Improve Collaboration

I plan to start writing weekly short summaries of my design progress (e.g., wireframes, usability test outcomes) and post them in the team thread or GitHub issue comments. This will help keep the team in the loop, especially since we may work at different times or asynchronously.
