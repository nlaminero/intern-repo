# ✨ Focus Bear Internship – Learning Goals

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I hope to hone my skills in UX design by creating better designs for neurodivergent users. 

## What skills are you most excited to develop?
I’m mostly excited to develop my Figma prototyping, wireframing, and UX writing skills. I also want to get more confident using GitHub to manage and present design work.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I am passionate with anything design related and I have empathy for users with ADHD/autism. I can offer clear visual improvements and give honest feedback from a fresh perspective.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I feel less confident using Git and GitHub for version control. I’d like to learn how to work with branches and commit changes properly.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success means seeing some of my design suggestions implemented, and being able to explain the design decisions behind them. It also means growing as a confident UX contributor.
