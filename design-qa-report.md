## 🔍 Research Summary

###  What is Design QA?

Design QA (Quality Assurance) is the process of reviewing the final developed product against the original design specs. It ensures that visual components, user flows, and interactions are consistent and meet accessibility and UX standards.

### Common Design Inconsistencies

- Incorrect spacing or alignment
- Wrong font size or color
- Missing hover or animation states
- Unclear or broken interaction flow
- Button styles or icons not matching design system

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- Figma Inspect Mode
- Chrome DevTools (to check padding, spacing, and fonts)
- Loom (for recording and communicating issues visually)

## 📝 Reflection

### 1. If a developer says a UI issue isn’t a priority...

I would advocate by:
- Explaining the **user impact** (e.g., confusion, accessibility concerns, brand inconsistency)
- Suggesting **low-effort fixes** if possible
- Using screenshots or user feedback to demonstrate the issue clearly
- Framing the issue as **maintaining trust and polish**

### 2. Risks of Skipping Design QA

- Users may feel the product is unfinished or unreliable
- Inaccessible components may harm inclusivity
- The brand image may become inconsistent
- Increased bug reports or support tickets

### 3. How to Give Clear QA Feedback

- Use numbered lists for issues
- Attach annotated screenshots (before/after)
- Group issues by priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Suggest quick fixes or alternatives
