## Summary

The session was held to align the UX and product teams on redesigning Focus Bear’s homepage. The UX lead presented user pain points and shared three possible redesign directions. Each intern selected an area of focus; I chose the **homepage redesign** to help create a calmer first impression for users.

## Key Problems Identified

- **Homepage Confusion:** Users want to see **tasks and habits immediately**, but the current layout feels cluttered with secondary elements.  
users also want an overview of the features and a button to direct them to view the full details of sections, for accessibility and quick view. 

- **Feature Clarity:** Some features feel confusing or heavy for first-time users; copy and layout need reworking.  

---

## Decisions Made

- Homepage should show only **high-level details** with “View All” links for full lists.  
- Distraction Blocker will be represented by a **passive icon**, not a toggle.  
- Dashboard-style layout to show key progress metrics and guide users into focused action.

## Action Items

- **Nina (UX Intern):** Create low-fidelity homepage wireframes focusing on homepage overview. 
- **Other UX Interns:** Explore onboarding flow improvements, focusing on shorter, more engaging steps and other features in Focus bear.   
- **Product Owner:** Review revised homepage copy for clarity and tone.  
- **Developers (to join in next sync):** Validate feasibility of dashboard layout and confirm responsive/mobile constraints.

## Reflection

This meeting clarified the real frustrations users face and helped me set design priorities. I now understand the importance of highlighting tasks and habits on the homepage, keeping visuals light, and ensuring the flow is consistent with homepage overview improvements.
