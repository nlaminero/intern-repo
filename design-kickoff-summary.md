## Summary

Today I attended a UX team meeting led by our UX lead to discuss improvements for Focus Bear’s onboarding experience and homepage. The meeting functioned as a design kickoff session to align the team on major UX problems and future directions.

During the session, our UX lead shared key user pain points and presented three possible design approaches. We were then invited to select a redesign area to focus on. I chose the **homepage redesign** based on my interest in helping users feel more grounded when they first enter the app.

## Key Problems Identified

- **Homepage Confusion:**  
  - Users want to see their **tasks and habits immediately**, not random elements like a large progress bar or cluttered content.  
  - Current layout feels overwhelming and lacks focus on key actions.

- **Onboarding Experience:**  
  - Onboarding is too long and repetitive.  
  - It lacks energy or visual excitement — the suggestion was to explore **gamification or animations** to keep users engaged.

- **Unclear Features:**  
  - Some features feel confusing or heavy for first-time users.  
  - Layout and copy need to be reworked for clarity and flow.

## Action Items for My Role

- Redesign the homepage to prioritize **habits and tasks** as the main entry points.  
- Remove or downplay secondary visual elements like progress bars that add clutter.  
- Begin sketching low-fidelity wireframes to organize layout and user focus.  
- Ensure the homepage aligns with the improved onboarding tone (e.g., more fun, less overwhelming).  
- Coordinate with other interns working on onboarding-related features to maintain consistency.

## Reflection

This meeting gave me a clearer understanding of the real user frustrations and helped me define my design priorities. I now understand the importance of showing value up front (tasks + habits) and minimizing noise. Although no developers were present, this session set the foundation for what I’ll eventually hand off — and gave me confidence in where to begin with homepage planning.
