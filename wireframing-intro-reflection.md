# Wireframing Intro Reflection   

## What is a Wireframe?

A wireframe is a simplified, visual representation of a product’s interface. It focuses on **layout**, **structure**, and **user flow** rather than colors, fonts, or detailed visuals. It shows what goes where, how users navigate, and what actions are available.

Unlike a prototype, which may include interaction and visual styling, a wireframe is often static and used for planning and feedback early in the process.

## Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Wireframes

| Type | Characteristics | Purpose |
|------|------------------|---------|
| **Low-Fidelity** | Sketchy, grayscale, minimal details | Quick exploration of layout and ideas |
| **High-Fidelity** | More detailed, includes real text and UI components | Bridges toward prototyping and developer handoff |

## When to Use Wireframes

Wireframes are typically used in the **early and mid-stages** of the UX design process:
- After defining user needs and goals
- During brainstorming and design exploration
- Before moving into high-fidelity design and testing
- When collaborating with PMs and developers to align on structure

## How Wireframes Improve Collaboration

- Help teams focus on structure and function without being distracted by visual details
- Allow faster feedback and iteration
- Provide a shared reference point between UX designers, developers, and product managers
- Prevent wasted effort by catching layout or logic issues early

## Reflection

**What are the benefits of starting with wireframes instead of high-fidelity design?**  
Wireframes are quicker to make and easier to change. They allow me to explore ideas and test layouts without being slowed down by visual styling. This saves time and keeps the focus on user experience and usability.

**How can wireframes help identify usability issues early?**  
Even basic wireframes reveal if navigation is confusing, if actions are hard to find, or if content hierarchy doesn’t make sense. Early feedback at this stage is easier (and cheaper) to act on.

**If a stakeholder asks for a high-fidelity design too soon, how would you explain the value of wireframing?**  
I’d explain that wireframes help us validate layout and flow before spending time on visuals. Jumping into high-fidelity too early risks rework, since we might be polishing a layout that doesn’t actually work for users. Wireframes make sure we’re solving the right problem before polishing the solution.
