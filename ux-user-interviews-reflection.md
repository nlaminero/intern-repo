# UX User Interviews & Usability Testing Reflection

## Best Practices for Conducting User Interviews

- **Ask open-ended questions** like “Can you walk me through what you expected here?” instead of yes/no questions.
- **Let the user lead** the conversation while gently probing for clarity.
- Avoid guiding or suggesting answers keep a neutral tone.
- Prepare a flexible script but allow room for follow-up questions based on user behavior.
- Make the user feel comfortable by reminding them there are no wrong answers.

## Best Practices for Usability Testing

- Clearly explain the task without describing *how* to do it.
- Say: “Please try to complete this task as you normally would” instead of “Click here, then here.”
- Encourage the user to “think aloud” so you can hear their thought process.
- Avoid reacting emotionally during the test (e.g., no gasping or praising prematurely).
- Observe rather than instruct — only help if they’re completely stuck.

## What Questions to Ask

- “What did you expect to happen here?”
- “Can you tell me what you’re thinking as you do this?”
- “Was anything confusing or unclear?”
- Avoid asking “Do you like it?” or “Would you use this?” as they can lead to polite but unreliable responses.

## Benefits of Recording & Note-Taking

- Allows replaying key moments to clarify observations.
- Helps validate findings across multiple sessions.
- Enables team members who didn’t attend to review the session.
- Improves consistency in analyzing user behavior and quotes.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Asking leading or biased questions
- Interrupting or over-explaining tasks
- Ignoring non-verbal cues or user frustration
- Not piloting the script or prototype beforehand
- Relying on memory instead of structured notes or recordings

## Reflection

**If a user struggles with a feature during testing, how do you know if it’s a UX problem or a learning curve issue?**  
You check if multiple users experience the same difficulty. If most struggle early, it’s likely a UX issue. If only one does and the others adjust quickly, it may be a learning curve. Context and consistency help determine the cause.

**How can UX designers ensure they don’t influence user responses during an interview?**  
By keeping a neutral tone, avoiding reactions like “good job” or “interesting,” and sticking to open-ended questions. Let the user explore freely and reflect their thoughts without inserting suggestions.

**What’s the best way to document usability testing results so they are useful for design decisions?**  
Use structured formats like:
- Task summaries (success/failure/time taken)
- Key observations and quotes
- Patterns and severity ratings
- Screenshots or video snippets for clarity

This makes it easier for the team to act on findings and prioritize issues.
