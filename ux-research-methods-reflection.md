# UX Research Methods Reflection 
## What are the two main types of UX research?

1. **Qualitative Research**  
   Focuses on understanding user behavior, motivations, and attitudes through direct observation and open-ended questions.  
   Examples: user interviews, usability testing, field studies.

2. **Quantitative Research**  
   Focuses on measurable data, such as usage statistics or survey responses.  
   Examples: surveys, analytics data, A/B testing.

## Common UX Research Methods

- **User Interviews** â€“ to gather in-depth insights into user needs and frustrations  
- **Usability Testing** â€“ to observe how users interact with the product  
- **Surveys** â€“ to gather broad feedback at scale  
- **A/B Testing** â€“ to test which version of a design performs better  
- **Analytics Review** â€“ to analyze user behavior at scale  
- **Card Sorting** â€“ to test information architecture and navigation

## When to Use Observational vs. Self-Reported Feedback

- **Observational Research** is best when users may not be able to explain their behavior accurately (e.g., usability testing).
- **Self-Reported Feedback** is useful for understanding user opinions, motivations, and preferences (e.g., surveys and interviews).

## Remote vs. In-Person Research

| Format | Benefits | Limitations |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Remote** | Wider reach, cost-effective, convenient | Harder to read body language, possible distractions |
| **In-Person** | Richer feedback, easier to observe reactions | More time-consuming and costly |

## Reflection: Improving Focus Bear's Onboarding Experience

To improve onboarding, the most useful UX research methods would be:

- **Moderated usability testing** to observe confusion or hesitation during onboarding  
- **User interviews** to explore pain points and expectations  
- **Surveys** to gather feedback from a larger sample after onboarding

These methods combine both observational and self-reported data, giving a balanced view of user experience.

## Challenges with Self-Reported Feedback

- Users may **forget key details**, **overestimate their success**, or **answer based on what they think you want to hear**.
- Responses can also be **influenced by mood or context**, leading to unreliable data.

## Avoiding Bias in UX Research

- Use **neutral language** in questions  
- Avoid leading participants or explaining too much  
- Observe behavior as well as listening to feedback  
- Include **diverse participants** to reduce skewed results

ðŸ‘‰ *Personal Example:* When I explored Focus Bearâ€™s onboarding flow, I noticed that setting up multiple habits at once felt overwhelming â€” I personally skipped through it quickly without really customizing. If I were running a **usability test**, Iâ€™d watch for this same behavior in new users to confirm whether the number of choices is too high. A **survey** afterwards could ask how confident they felt about their setup. Combining both methods would reveal whether the friction is from unclear instructions, too many steps, or lack of perceived value.
