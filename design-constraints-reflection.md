#  Design Constraints & Technical Feasibility Reflection

##  Reflection

### If a developer tells you a design is too complex to implement, how would you respond?

I would first ask for clarification about which part of the design is complex. Then, I’d work collaboratively to understand the technical limitations—whether it’s related to time, frameworks, or backend dependencies. I’d try to simplify the component while keeping the user experience and accessibility intact. For example, if an animation is hard to implement, I might suggest a more basic motion or visual cue that still communicates user feedback.

###  What are some non-visual factors that impact UX design?

- **Performance:** Large images, animations, or excessive scripts can slow down load times and affect usability.
- **Accessibility:** Even if a design looks good, it must meet accessibility standards (e.g., screen reader support, contrast ratios, keyboard navigation).
- **Load time:** A design that relies heavily on external resources may create delays that frustrate users.
- **Responsiveness:** Layouts need to work across different devices, which sometimes limits how detailed or decorative a design can be.

###  How can UX designers help find middle-ground solutions?

UX designers can:
- Use **design tokens** or design systems to offer reusable components with consistent code support.
- Prioritize **essential features** that align with user goals and drop or simplify lower-impact elements.
- Provide **alternate wireframes or mockups** with different levels of fidelity to compare effort vs. value.
- Include **annotations in Figma** to highlight what’s flexible vs. what’s crucial for usability or accessibility.
- Stay in regular communication with devs during sprints to iterate quickly and adjust designs early.
