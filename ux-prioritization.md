# UX Prioritization Proposal – Focus Bear

## Goal

To understand how to collaborate with Product Managers (PMs) to prioritize UX improvements while balancing business goals and development timelines.

---

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### How do PMs decide which UX improvements to prioritize?

PMs look at:
- **User impact**: How many users are affected and how severe the issue is.
- **Business goals**: Whether the improvement helps achieve KPIs (e.g., retention, engagement).
- **Development effort**: Whether the dev team can implement it easily or if it will take a long time.
- **User feedback**: Issues raised repeatedly by users get higher priority.
- **Technical feasibility**: Some improvements might sound easy but involve major architectural changes.

###  Prioritization Frameworks

- **RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)**: Helps assign a score to features or improvements to compare value vs. effort.
- **MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have)**: Categorizes work based on urgency and necessity.

## 📝 Reflection

### 1. If a PM tells you there’s no time for a UX improvement, how would you respond?

I’d first ask if we can:
- **Defer** it to the next sprint or tag it as a backlog item.
- **Scope down** the improvement to something quicker.
- Share **user feedback** or data (e.g., drop-off rate, session recordings) to show the real impact.

I would also try to frame the fix not just as “design polish” but as a way to improve user retention, reduce churn, or increase engagement.

### 2. How can UX designers ensure that important usability issues don’t get ignored?

- Log issues clearly in the task board with labels like `usability` or `high-friction`.
- Back the issue up with user quotes, metrics, or video clips.
- Share summaries in sprint planning or async channels.
- If needed, push for a "usability sprint" to fix small but high-impact issues.

---

### 3. What’s the best way to present UX work as a business priority?

Frame the UX work like this:
- “Improving this will reduce confusion during onboarding and likely lower our 40% drop-off rate.”
- “Fixing this saves user time and improves daily retention.”
- “This feature improves accessibility and helps us reach more users.”

**Use data + user stories + effort estimates** to make it easy for PMs to see value.

##  Example UX Improvement

**Issue**: Editing a habit requires going to settings, which is unintuitive.  
**Impact**: Users feel frustrated when they want to quickly modify routines.  
**Proposal**: Add a visible “Edit” icon directly in the habit view tab.  
**Effort**: Low (1–2 dev hours).  
**User Impact**: High (faster workflows, less confusion).

**RICE Score Example**:
- Reach: 6/10  
- Impact: 8/10  
- Confidence: 7/10  
- Effort: 2/10  
- **Total Score**: 105
