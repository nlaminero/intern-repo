# Agile Principles Reflection

## What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
Agile is a flexible and iterative approach to product development. Unlike traditional project management (like Waterfall), where everything is planned and executed in strict phases, Agile focuses on continuous improvement, collaboration, and adapting quickly to change. Agile allows teams to deliver value faster by working in smaller chunks and responding to feedback along the way.

## What are the core values and principles of Agile?
Agile is based on four core values from the Agile Manifesto:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a fixed plan

It also includes 12 principles, like delivering working software frequently, welcoming change, and maintaining sustainable pace. One of the most relevant for UX is “continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.”

## What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
- **Scrum** is based on fixed-length sprints (usually 1–2 weeks), with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner), and ceremonies like sprint planning, retrospectives, and stand-ups. It’s great when you want structured planning and sprint goals.
- **Kanban** is more flexible — tasks move continuously through a board without fixed timeboxes. There are no required roles or ceremonies, and work is pulled when capacity allows. It’s ideal for fast-paced teams that deal with evolving priorities (like UX).

## Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
Focus Bear prefers Kanban because the work is often fast-changing, especially in design and product experimentation. UX tasks, bug fixes, and feedback can come in at any time, so it makes more sense to work with a continuous flow instead of locking features into a sprint.

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
The biggest benefit is flexibility we can quickly adapt if a feature needs to change or if user feedback reveals a better direction. It also helps with team alignment and makes sure everyone stays connected. The biggest challenge is balancing speed with thoughtful design. it can be tempting to rush, but UX still needs time to test and validate ideas.

### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
Agile encourages communication and constant feedback, which helps me as a UX designer make better decisions. I can share early drafts, test small parts of a feature, and improve based on team or user feedback. It also makes me feel like I’m part of the full development process, not just “handing off” designs.

## Scrum vs. Kanban Summary (In My Own Words)
- **Scrum** = fixed sprints, more structure, detailed planning and ceremonies  
- **Kanban** = continuous flow, fewer rules, work pulled as needed  
Scrum is good when the team needs clear sprint goals. Kanban works better when priorities change quickly and everyone needs flexibility.

## One Agile Principle That Will Be Most Useful for Me:
**“Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”**  
This reminds me not to overcomplicate features or designs. As a UX designer, it's easy to want to build every possible option, but the best user experience is often the simplest and clearest one.
