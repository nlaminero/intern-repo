# Competitive Landscape Reflection

## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear is different because it was designed specifically for neurodivergent users, like people with ADHD and Autism. Most other productivity apps are built for general users and assume you can self-manage once the tool is there. But Focus Bear actually guides you through your habits in real-time, using timers and visual cues, and blocks distractions across both phone and desktop. It blends structure, science, and routine guidance not just setting screentimes.

## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I would choose Focus Bear if I needed something that tells me what to do next, instead of just giving me a to-do list. thinking as  someone who can get overwhelmed by decision fatigue or distracted easily, Focus Bear’s routine guidance and built-in breaks feel more like a coach than a tool. I’d also choose it for the friendly, supportive tone that doesn’t feel robotic.

## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
My routine app has a calendar on the UI so users can easily access what routines they have to do on a specific day. it also has minimal design to reduce clutter and promote healthier habits. 
## Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Focus Bear could improve by making it easier to edit routines directly from the Habits tab. Right now, you have to go into the Settings to make changes, which feels disconnected. If users could tap an “Edit” icon or long-press a routine step right in the Habits view, it would feel more intuitive especially for ADHD users who need fast, direct access without digging through menus.
