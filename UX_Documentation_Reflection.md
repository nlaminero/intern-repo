# UX Documentation Reflection

## What types of UX documentation are typically created in Google Docs?
In Google Docs, UX designers often create documents like user research summaries, interview transcripts, usability testing notes, user personas, user journey maps (described in text), design rationale, meeting notes, and feature proposals. It’s also used for collaborative feedback, especially when working with non-designers like product managers or developers.

## How should design decisions and rationale be documented for future reference?
Each major design decision should be explained with context — what problem was being solved, what user feedback led to the change, and why the final solution was chosen. Screenshots or Figma links help support the explanation. It’s helpful to include timestamps or version numbers to track how decisions evolved.

## What is the best way to structure user research findings to make them easy to read?
User research findings should be grouped by themes or pain points. A simple layout might include:
- A summary of what was tested
- Key observations or quotes
- The user need or problem
- Suggested design changes
Bullet points, tables, and headings help break up the content so it’s scannable for developers or product leads.

## How can UX documentation be used to support accessibility and inclusive design?
When documenting UX, we can include notes about specific user needs — for example, how a layout helps users with ADHD stay focused, or how color choices affect users with vision impairments. We can also log accessibility standards being followed (e.g., contrast ratio, keyboard navigation). This helps the whole team stay aware of inclusive goals.

## Reflection

### If you conducted a user testing session, how would you document the results?
I would create a shared Google Doc and include: the date, the test goals, who participated, what tasks they did, and the key observations. I’d summarize pain points in bullet points and include quotes or screenshots if needed. Then I’d list clear next steps or design changes based on what I learned.

### How can a well-structured UX document help prevent miscommunication between teams?
It gives everyone one clear source of truth. If a dev or product manager is unsure why something was designed a certain way, they can just check the document. This prevents assumptions and helps make decisions faster, especially when the team is remote or cross-functional.

### What challenges might arise when writing UX documentation, and how can you avoid them?
Sometimes the biggest challenge is writing too much or not knowing what’s important to include. It’s also easy to forget to update documentation when changes happen. To avoid this, I would focus on summarizing only the most relevant info, using headings to organize content, and linking out to updated designs or pages when needed.
