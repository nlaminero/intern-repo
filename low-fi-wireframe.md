## Summary

This low-fidelity wireframe addresses the usability issues uncovered during a real in-person test (see `ux-usability-test-report.md`). Based on the feedback from the participant (Dhenzel) and direction from my supervisor, I focused on simplifying the layout, highlighting key user tasks, and reducing visual clutter.

---

## Design Goals

- Prioritize showing **Habits** and **Tasks** on the homepage, as requested by users.
- Reduce distractions by removing or downplaying the **progress bar** and unnecessary content.
- Maintain consistency in layout, spacing, and readability.

## Key Wireframe Updates

| Issue Addressed | Design Change in Wireframe |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Homepage didn’t show habits/tasks clearly | Created dedicated sections with visible headers for “Today’s Tasks” and “Habits” |
| Progress bar distracted the user | Replaced with a simple status message or left out entirely |
| UI felt overwhelming | Used clean boxes, fewer visual elements, and clear grouping |
| No visual flow from onboarding to homepage | Added space for a gentle onboarding reminder or “Welcome Back” area |
| Confusing emoji or character | Removed language-changing bears and focused on static avatars only |

---

## Tools Used

- Figma (low-fidelity frame using gray boxes, basic icons, and structure-only UI)
