# Low-Fidelity Wireframe Submission – Homepage Redesign

**Author:** Nina Rae  
**Date:** July 28, 2025  
**Feature:** Homepage Redesign  
**Figma Link:** [Focus Bear Low-Fi Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/oCKwqlP1hp1564BtaHx3OS/Focus-Bear-Homepage-%E2%80%93-Low-Fi-Wireframe?node-id=0-1&t=3FPu8o2VIJPXX2SG-1)

## Summary

This low-fidelity wireframe was created to explore the structure of the homepage layout for the Focus Bear app. It initially focused on displaying tasks, habits, and checklist features in one place.

However, after reviewing it with my supervisor Mia, I’ve received valuable feedback about the purpose of the homepage. It should act more like a **snapshot** of the user’s day — not a full functional page — and should **link out to** core features like habits and schedule.

I am currently sketching a new wireframe based on this feedback and will update this file once it’s ready for review.

## Design Goals (Initial Version)

- Prioritize showing **Habits** and **Tasks** on the homepage.
- Reduce distractions by removing or downplaying progress bars and unnecessary visual noise.
- Ensure consistent layout, spacing, and user-friendly readability.

## Key Wireframe Updates (First Draft)

| Issue Addressed | Design Change in Wireframe |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Homepage didn’t show habits/tasks clearly | Created visible sections for “Today’s Tasks” and “Habits” |
| Progress bar distracted the user | Removed and replaced with a simplified text message |
| UI felt overwhelming | Reduced clutter by grouping elements and using simple components |
| Confusing onboarding flow | Added space for a “Welcome Back” section |
| Overuse of icons/emoji | Replaced with neutral, minimal icons and text |

## Tools Used

- **Figma** – low-fidelity wireframe using gray UI blocks, placeholder text, and layout structure

---

## Feedback from Supervisor (Mia)

- The homepage should **only display high-level details**, not allow full interaction (e.g., adding tasks or checking habits).
- Display a **few key habits or tasks**, not the full list — users should tap into the full view for more.
- The **Distraction Blocker UI** should be shown as a **passive icon**, not a toggle or interactive element.
- Use a **dashboard-style layout**, similar to reference images provided, to convey progress and guide the user.
- The goal is to **minimize friction** and guide users into focused action.

## Next Steps

- Redesign the homepage wireframe based on the above feedback
- Focus on a **modular card layout** with quick insights and clean shortcuts
- Submit updated version for further review before proceeding to high-fidelity design
