# Low-Fidelity Wireframe Submission – Homepage Redesign

**Author:** Nina Rae  
**Date:** July 28, 2025  
**Feature:** Homepage Redesign  
**Figma Link:** [Focus Bear Low-Fi Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/oCKwqlP1hp1564BtaHx3OS/Focus-Bear-Homepage-%E2%80%93-Low-Fi-Wireframe?node-id=0-1&t=3FPu8o2VIJPXX2SG-1)

## Summary

This low-fidelity wireframe was created to explore the structure of the homepage layout for the Focus Bear app. It initially focused on displaying tasks, habits, and checklist features in one place.

However, after reviewing it with my supervisor Mia, I’ve received valuable feedback about the purpose of the homepage. It should act more like a **snapshot** of the user’s day — not a full functional page — and should **link out to** core features like habits and schedule.

I am currently sketching a new wireframe based on this feedback and will update this file once it’s ready for review.

## Design Goals (Initial Version)

- Prioritize showing **Habits** and **Tasks** on the homepage.
- Reduce distractions by removing or downplaying progress bars and unnecessary visual noise.
- Ensure consistent layout, spacing, and user-friendly readability.

## Key Wireframe Updates (First Draft)

| Issue Addressed | Design Change in Wireframe |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Homepage didn’t show habits/tasks clearly | Created visible sections for “Today’s Tasks” and “Habits” |
| Progress bar distracted the user | Removed and replaced with a simplified text message |
| UI felt overwhelming | Reduced clutter by grouping elements and using simple components |
| Confusing onboarding flow | Added space for a “Welcome Back” section |
| Overuse of icons/emoji | Replaced with neutral, minimal icons and text |

## Tools Used

- **Figma** – low-fidelity wireframe using gray UI blocks, placeholder text, and layout structure

## Feedback from Supervisor (Mia)

- The homepage should **only display high-level details**, not allow full interaction (e.g., adding tasks or checking habits).
- Display a **few key habits or tasks**, not the full list — users should tap into the full view for more.
- The **Distraction Blocker UI** should be shown as a **passive icon**, not a toggle or interactive element.
- Use a **dashboard-style layout**, similar to reference images provided, to convey progress and guide the user.
- The goal is to **minimize friction** and guide users into focused action.

## After Iterating feedbacks 
I used dahsboard layout style as suggested by Mia, I also designed ways to make the space feel more complete as stated by jeremy. The screenshot below is the redeisgned version of the original low fidelity wireframe, addressing all the suggested feedbacks from above.

Based on Mia’s feedback, I simplified the homepage to only show high-level details, such as a few current habits and a quick progress snapshot. Full lists and interactions (like adding tasks or toggling habits) were moved into deeper screens, applying **progressive disclosure** to reduce clutter.  

From Jeremy’s notes, I shifted the layout into a **dashboard style**, using clear sections and visual hierarchy to highlight the most important actions. I also changed the Distraction Blocker into a passive icon instead of a toggle, which aligns with the goal of keeping the homepage friction-free.  

The final iteration focuses on **guiding users into focused action** while keeping the UI calm and distraction-free. After feedback from Mia, I simplified the homepage so it only shows high-level details (snapshot view) and moved full interactions like adding tasks into deeper screens. From Jeremy’s comments, I restructured the layout into a dashboard style, added more emphasis on the schedule, and filled empty space to make the design feel complete. The final iteration balances clarity with minimal friction, guiding users into focused action. All in all, i have iterated more than 3 wireframes and showed options when persenting.
