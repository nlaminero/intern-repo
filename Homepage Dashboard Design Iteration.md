# Homepage / Dashboard Design Progress

## 🖼️ My Initial Wireframes
Before receiving Mia’s designs, I created my own low-fidelity wireframes for the homepage.  
These focused on:
- Habits (morning and evening routines)
- Daily schedule

This gave me a base structure, but it leaned more towards a homepage list rather than a dashboard.

## 🖌️ Feedback & New Direction
After seeing Mia’s design explorations and feedback from Jeremy, I pivoted to a **dashboard approach**.  
The goal was to provide a **quick-glance overview** of habits, Schedule, tasks and Focus Sessions using **widget-style components**.

Mia's Design:

My Design:

## 🔄 Iterations
- **Idea 1 – Vertical Scroll**: Scrollable homepage showing habits, schedule, and tasks stacked vertically.

- **Idea 2 – Tabbed Dashboard**: Tabs to switch between Habits, Tasks, Schedule, and Focus.

- **Idea 3 – Hybrid Overview**: Condensed snapshot of all three (Schedule, Morning Routine, Top Tasks) on one screen with “View All” links.

## 🎨 High-Fidelity Prototype
I then developed **Idea 3** into high-fidelity designs (Opt 1, Opt 2, Opt 2.1).  
Key features:
- **Schedule widget** with current time indicator.  
- **Morning Routine widget** with progress bar and checkboxes.  
- **Top Tasks widget** with urgency levels and points.  
- **Calendar navigation** (added in Opt 2.1).  
- **Clear links (“View All”)** to full feature pages.  
- **Bottom nav bar** for intuitive access to other areas.

## ✅ How It Meets the Requirements
- **Quick glance overview**: Displays habits, tasks, and schedule at once.  
- **Widget-style components**: Modular, scannable design.  
- **Daily progress**: Routine completion shown
- **Navigation**: Both “View All” links and bottom nav provide smooth access to detailed screens.  
- **Iteration evidence**: Showcases journey from initial wireframes → team feedback → final hi-fi.

---

## 📈 Next Steps
- Add a **Daily Progress widget** (ring or streak tracker) to make progress even clearer.  
- Consider optional widgets (e.g., Focus Summary, Points Earned) to expand functionality.
