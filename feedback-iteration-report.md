## Summary

This report summarizes 8 user experience improvements based on the video feedback session. Each improvement is prioritized and includes any constraints that may impact implementation.

## Suggested Improvements

| # | Issue Observed | Suggested UX Change | Potential Constraints | Priority |
|---|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------|
| 1 | Onboarding is too long | Shorten onboarding into 3–4 digestible steps or allow user to skip | May require UX flow changes or dev time | High |
| 2 | App feels too strict, like it’s “parenting” me | Soften tone of app language to feel more supportive | Requires UX/content review | Medium |
| 3 | “What can you achieve?” question too overwhelming | Reword prompt to something simpler like “What’s your goal today?” | UX copy update | High |
| 4 | “When do you finish work lately?” question too long | Shorten to “When do you usually finish work?” | Simple copy change | Medium |
| 5 | "What time do you go to sleep?" question is too long | Change to “Bedtime?” or “What time do you sleep?” | Simple content update | Medium |
| 6 | Task labels (e.g. “Research paper”) felt too small | Increase font size and spacing for clarity | Visual UI tweak | High |
| 7 | Confusion on clicking vs checking off tasks | Add tooltip or visual guide showing how to complete tasks | UI design work | High |
| 8 | Too much neon green in app design | Adjust green shade or balance it with more neutral tones | May affect branding palette | Low |

## Prioritization Rationale

High priority changes directly affect usability, clarity, and user motivation. Medium priority ones improve tone and comprehension. The neon color feedback is aesthetic and may require design team input, so it is lower priority.

## Next Steps

- Discuss implementation feasibility with the development team
- Update Figma file with adjusted copy, font size, and button styles
- Re-test revised onboarding and task flow with new users
