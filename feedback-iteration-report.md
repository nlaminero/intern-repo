## Summary

This report summarizes 8 user experience improvements based on the video feedback session. Each improvement is prioritized and includes any constraints that may impact implementation.

## Suggested Improvements

| # | Issue Observed | Suggested UX Change | Potential Constraints | Priority |
|---|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------|
| 1 | Onboarding is too long | Shorten onboarding into 3–4 digestible steps or allow user to skip | May require UX flow changes or dev time | High |
| 2 | App feels too strict, like it’s “parenting” me, not like a tool | Have an alternative to reduce strictness level | Requires UX/content review | Medium |
| 3 | “What can you achieve?” question too overwhelming and  requires users to type | Reword prompt to something simpler like “What’s your goals?” and it should give options for users to click | UX copy update | High |
| 4 | “When do you finish work lately?” question too long | Shorten to “When do you usually finish work?” | Simple copy change | Medium |
| 5 | The UI can be improved| build better UI design to encourage users to use the app |requires UI/UX review | High |
| 6 | some icons, typography were too small | Increase font size, icons and spacing for clarity | Visual UI tweak | High |
| 7 | Confusion on clicking vs checking off tasks | Add tooltip or visual guide showing how to complete tasks or design the prompt to look uneditable | UI design work | High |
| 8 | The 'x' button did not delete the options clicked, instead it lead users to the previous page | Add a previous button on the left side to redo user error | May require UX flow changes or dev time | High |

## Prioritization Rationale

High priority changes directly affect usability, clarity, and user motivation. Medium priority ones improve tone and comprehension. The neon color feedback is aesthetic and may require design team input, so it is lower priority.

## Next Steps

- Discuss implementation feasibility with the development team
- Update Figma file with adjusted copy, font size, and button styles
- Re-test revised onboarding and task flow with new users
