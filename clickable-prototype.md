## Reflection

### What usability issues can a clickable prototype reveal that a static wireframe cannot?
Clickable prototypes help reveal problems like broken navigation, lack of user feedback when clicking buttons, or unclear transitions between screens. These issues aren't visible in static screens.

### How can prototyping help designers communicate ideas more clearly to developers?
Prototypes make ideas easier to understand by showing how users will actually move through the design. Developers can follow interactions instead of guessing how something should work.

### What are common mistakes designers make when creating prototypes?
- Missing interactions or broken links between screens.
- Using confusing or inconsistent transitions.
- Not naming layers and frames clearly.
- Trying to prototype every detail too early.

## Prototype Status

### Completed:
- Connected major tabs (Schedule and Habits).
- Set up some click actions (like "I'm finished" under Habits).
- Basic structure for calendar navigation and layout complete.

### Incomplete or To Be Improved:
1. “I’m finished” button doesn’t visually mark checklist item as completed.
2. No confirmation or undo option for habit check actions.
3. Checkmarks under Schedule tab aren’t functional yet.
4. “Add New Habit” pop-up UI is still being refined.
5. Calendar needs horizontal scroll and content update based on date.
6. Bottom navigation bar is incomplete and not fully linked.

## Next Steps
- Improve interactions (add missing states and transitions).
- Finalize UI for habit creation and editing.
- Test full prototype flow from onboarding to daily habit view.
- Submit for design critique and update based on feedback.
