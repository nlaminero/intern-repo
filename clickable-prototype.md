## Reflection

### What usability issues can a clickable prototype reveal that a static wireframe cannot?
Clickable prototypes help reveal issues like broken navigation, lack of user feedback when tapping buttons, and unclear transitions between screens — problems that static wireframes can't show.

### How can prototyping help designers communicate ideas more clearly to developers?
Prototypes demonstrate actual user flow and behavior. Developers can see the intended interactions rather than making assumptions from flat mockups.

### What are common mistakes designers make when creating prototypes?
- Missing or broken interactions
- Inconsistent transitions
- Unclear or unnamed layers/frames
- Trying to add too much detail too early

## Prototype Status

### ✅ Completed:
- Navigation between **Schedule** and **Habits** tabs
- Interactive "I'm finished" habit checklist flow
- Structure in place for calendar and daily layout

### ⚠️ In Progress or Needs Improvement:
1. “I’m finished” button does not yet mark task as completed visually
2. No confirmation or undo for checking habits
3. Checkmarks in **Schedule tab** are not functional yet
4. “Add New Habit” overlay is still being revised
5. Calendar design lacks date-based dynamic updates
6. Bottom nav bar is not fully functional or linked

## Feedback Summary

Mia provided feedback via email, highlighting the following improvements for the homepage prototype:

- The homepage should act as a **snapshot**, not a fully interactive screen  
- Only **key habits or tasks** should be shown, not the full list  
- The **Distraction Blocker UI** should use a **passive icon**, not a toggle  
- Suggested using a **dashboard-style layout** (cards, summaries, links out to full features)  
- Included visual references to guide the next version  

---

## Next Steps
- Redesign the homepage to align with Mia’s feedback
- Refactor interaction flow for habit tracking
- Finalize the “Add Habit” overlay experience
- Improve navigation bar and calendar scroll
- Test end-to-end flow before moving to high-fidelity prototype
