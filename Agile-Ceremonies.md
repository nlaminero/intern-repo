# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration – Focus Bear

## What are the main Agile ceremonies and their purpose?

- **Daily Stand-ups**  
Quick, daily meetings where each team member shares what they did yesterday, what they’re doing today, and any blockers. It keeps everyone aligned and helps surface problems early.

- **Sprint Planning (Scrum)**  
A team decides what tasks to complete in the upcoming sprint (usually 1–2 weeks). Everyone estimates effort, prioritizes tasks, and agrees on the sprint goals.

- **Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**  
Unlike Scrum, Kanban doesn’t use sprints. Work is continuously prioritized and pulled in when capacity is available, which can work better for design tasks that evolve rapidly.

- **Retrospectives**  
Held at the end of a sprint to reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and what the team can improve. It encourages open feedback and team growth.

- **Backlog Refinement**  
The team reviews and updates the backlog by breaking down tasks, adding detail, and re-prioritizing. It keeps the workflow clean and focused.

## How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
Agile teams use tools like Slack, Notion, GitHub, Figma, and shared docs to stay updated even when working in different time zones. Tasks are clearly written, comments are left in context (like in Figma or GitHub), and decisions are documented for visibility. Stand-ups can be done via async updates if needed.

## Reflection

### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Agile ceremonies make sure everyone stays connected, even when they work on different parts of the project. Stand-ups help surface blockers early, and retrospectives give the team space to share what’s working or not. They make the process more human and transparent.

### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
Retrospectives are most important for me as a UX designer because they allow reflection on how my designs were received, whether devs had issues implementing them, and how the user experience evolved. It's also where I can share if I felt rushed or unclear about a task, and suggest smoother design-dev collaboration.
