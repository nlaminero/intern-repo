#  Professionalism Reflection 

## Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
Yes, in a past group project, I worked with a team that was respectful, communicative, and open to feedback. Everyone took responsibility for their tasks and helped each other without judgment. What made it work was that we checked in regularly, gave each other space to speak, and solved problems together instead of blaming. That made the experience both productive and enjoyable.

## What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
- Use friendly but clear language in Slack and comments.
- Ask questions if I don’t understand something rather than making assumptions.
- Avoid sarcasm or tone that could be misread, especially in written messages.
- Respect different working styles, and give teammates time to respond.

## How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
- Be approachable and supportive celebrate small wins and encourage others.
- Use humor appropriately, without excluding or offending anyone.
- Be consistent with updates and follow through with tasks.
- Contribute to team culture by sharing positive energy and helping where I can.

## How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
- Read the agenda beforehand (or request one if it’s not provided).
- Bring questions or updates I want to share.
- Be on time, take notes, and stay focused during the meeting.
- Follow up with a short summary or action items if needed.

## What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
- Taking initiative on small tasks without being asked.
- Offering design improvements when I notice a usability issue.
- Checking in with the team regularly if I'm unsure about priorities.
- Asking for feedback before finalizing things, not after.

## How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them?
- I’d start with a polite messag/ email or tag them in GitHub/Figma.
- If there’s no response after a few days, I’d follow up once more.
- If still no reply, I’d escalate by checking in with another team member or lead but only after giving enough time and context.

### How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
If the issue is urgent or blocking work and I’ve followed up twice without a reply, I’d reach out to the team lead or supervisor directly. If it’s related to a serious professionalism concern (e.g., bullying, exclusion, or breach of conduct), I would contact the CEO using the phone number in the onboarding doc.

## What are some things you won't do?
- I won’t ignore messages or leave people hanging if I’m tagged or asked a question.
- I won’t joke in ways that might hurt or exclude someone, even unintentionally.
- I won’t rush work without checking accessibility or user needs.
- I won’t take feedback personally — instead, I’ll use it to improve and grow.
