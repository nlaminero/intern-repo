# Kanban Workflow Reflection

## How Kanban Works

A Kanban board is a visual task management system that helps teams manage workflow in real-time. Tasks are represented as cards that move across columns such as “Backlog”, “In Progress”, “Blocked”, and “Done.” Each column represents a stage in the task lifecycle. Team members move tasks between columns as progress is made.

## Observations from Focus Bear’s Kanban Board

- The board is currently structured into columns by **priority or status**, such as:
  - Super low priority
  - Very low priority
  - Blocked
  - Next fundraising round
  - Unprioritized


- At the time of checking, only one draft task existed:  
  **“Integrate with Azure Event Hub”** under “Very low priority.”

This suggests that the board is still being set up or that priorities are currently being re-evaluated.

## How Tasks Move & Responsibility

- In typical Kanban workflows, tasks are updated by the **team member assigned** to that task.
- Tasks move from “Unprioritized” or “Backlog” to “In Progress”, and eventually to “Done.”
- If a task is blocked (e.g., waiting on another team or decision), it moves to the “Blocked” column for visibility.

## Benefits of Limiting WIP (Work In Progress)

- Prevents overload by ensuring team members don’t multitask excessively.
- Encourages focus on completing tasks rather than starting too many.
- Makes bottlenecks visible so they can be resolved.

## Personal Reflection

**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**  
Kanban provides a clear visual snapshot of what’s being worked on, what’s blocked, and what’s next. This makes it easier to focus on current tasks and not get distracted by future work. It also prevents team members from taking on too much at once.

**How can I improve my workflow using Kanban principles?**  
I can start breaking my design and research tasks into smaller items and update their status in GitHub Projects. Even if my tasks aren’t assigned officially yet, I can use labels like “In progress” or “Pending review” to track my own workflow and show accountability.

**Next Step I Took:**  
Since the board had no active tasks under execution, I plan to create or update a task in the “Unprioritized” column to reflect my recent work (e.g., wireframe iteration or usability testing documentation) and move it through the board as I complete it.
