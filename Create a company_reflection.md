# ✨ Company reflection

## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
I think Focus Bear was created because the founder, Jeremy, personally understood how hard it is to manage ADHD and autism in a world that expects you to stay productive all the time.
He was struggling himself, and after trying every other app and method, he decided to make something that would actually work for neurodivergent people something that combined structure, science, and lived experience.

## What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Too many distractions (phone, email, social media)
People struggling to stick to routines or do it
Feeling overwhelmed by choices or tasks
Apps that are too soft or don’t work for neurodivergent brains

## Why do you think this mission is important?
productivity tools are usually made for neurotypical users and they often don’t work for people who process the world differently. There’s a huge gap in accessibility and understanding, especially for teens and adults who are only recently diagnosed. 
Giving people the right tools to function better can change their whole life not just how they study or work, but their mental health too.

## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
I care deeply about inclusive design, and I’m always thinking about how apps feel — not just how they look. I’m studying cyber security and design, and I want to build tools that make life easier for people, especially those who are often overlooked.
Focus Bear’s mission to support neurodivergent users matches what I believe in tech should be made everyone not just ideal users.

## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Yes even though I am not diagnosed, I’ve had days where I felt really scattered, where I had good intentions but couldn’t stick to what I planned. I have also fostered a child who is neurodivergent, and I see him struggle with routines, starting tasks, or bouncing between hyperfocus and burnout. 
I think Focus Bear would help people like him feel more in control and less overwhelmed. Even people without a diagnosis can benefit from this kind of structure.
