# Kanban Workflow Reflection – Focus Bear

## How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A Kanban board visually represents the flow of work. It helps manage tasks by breaking them down into stages (like To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Done). This makes it easy to see the status of every task and identify bottlenecks. It’s especially useful in asynchronous teams where everyone can check the board for updates without needing constant meetings.

## What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?
- **Backlog** – Tasks that are not yet prioritized or ready to be worked on.
- **To Do / Ready** – Prioritized tasks that are ready to be picked up next.
- **In Progress** – Tasks that someone is actively working on.
- **Blocked** – Tasks that can’t move forward due to a dependency or issue.
- **Done** – Completed tasks, ready for review or closed.

## How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
Tasks move across the board as the team works on them. The person working on a task is usually responsible for updating its status. In Focus Bear’s case, that means dragging cards across columns in the GitHub Projects board and updating the labels or descriptions if needed.

## What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
Limiting WIP helps avoid multitasking overload, which can cause delays and stress. It keeps focus on finishing existing tasks instead of starting too many at once. For neurodivergent users, this is even more helpful because it reduces context-switching and builds momentum by completing tasks.

## Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban boards help me see exactly what’s important right now. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by a huge list of tasks, I can focus on what’s in the “In Progress” column and only move on once that’s done. It also helps the team balance work — if one column is crowded, it signals that we need to unblock or finish tasks before starting more.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I can improve my workflow by checking the board daily and making sure I’m only working on one design task at a time. I’ll also use the Blocked column more actively, especially when I’m waiting for feedback or a dev decision, instead of just keeping it in my own notes. This will make things more visible for the rest of the team.
