## 📝 Reflection  
Creating the high-fidelity prototype helped me understand the importance of visual consistency and interaction details in UX design.  
- I learned how colors, spacing, and typography contribute to usability and branding.  
- Small details like hover states and button transitions improved the user experience.  
- I recognized the risk of focusing too much on visuals before validating usability.  

Overall, this task showed me how high-fidelity prototypes not only communicate the final look and feel to stakeholders but also guide developers in building the product accurately.
