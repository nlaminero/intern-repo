# High-Fidelity Prototype  

## Goal  
Transform a low-fidelity prototype into a high-fidelity design with visual details, animations, and refined interactions.  

---

## Why is this important?  
High-fidelity prototypes help communicate the final look and feel of the product.  
They provide realistic interactions, branding, and styling, making them essential for:  
- Stakeholder approval  
- Developer handoff

## Research & Learn  
- Difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes  
- Impact of colors, typography, and spacing on usability and accessibility  
- Best practices for animations and micro-interactions in Figma  
- Ensuring high-fidelity designs align with brand guidelines

## Iteration & Feedback Summary
I first created a low-fidelity homepage wireframe, which focused on showing tasks and habits. After sharing it, I received feedback: Mia suggested simplifying the homepage into a high-level snapshot view and Jeremy noted that the layout felt incomplete and needed clearer hierarchy.

Based on this, I redesigned the wireframe into a dashboard-style layout and then built the high-fidelity prototype. The updated design shows only key habits, tasks, and schedule items, while keeping the interface calm and balanced. I also added Top Task prioritisation scores as suggested, improved spacing, and reduced clutter, which makes the screen easier to scan and act on.

## Reflection  
Creating the high-fidelity prototype helped me understand the importance of visual consistency and interaction details in UX design.  
- I learned how colors, spacing, and typography contribute to usability and branding.  
- Small details like hover states and button transitions improved the user experience.  
- I recognized the risk of focusing too much on visuals before validating usability.  

Overall, this task showed me how high-fidelity prototypes not only communicate the final look and feel to stakeholders but also guide developers in building the product accurately.
