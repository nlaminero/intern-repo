# High-Fidelity Prototype  

## Summary
This milestone builds on my earlier low-fidelity wireframe. I transformed the wireframe into a high-fidelity prototype with Focus Bear’s design system applied using consistent colors, typography, and spacing. I also added interaction details such as button states and hover effects to better communicate the final look and feel.

## Why is this important?  
High-fidelity prototypes help communicate the final look and feel of the product.  
They provide realistic interactions, branding, and styling, making them essential for:  
- Stakeholder approval  
- Developer handoff

## Iteration & Feedback Summary

Mia’s feedback: Simplify the homepage into a snapshot view showing only key habits and tasks.
Jeremy’s feedback: Fill excessive empty space and improve hierarchy for clarity.
Iteration changes:
Shifted to a dashboard-style layout with high-level summaries.
Added “Top Task” prioritisation scores for clearer task levels.
Improved spacing, balance, and visual hierarchy to make the layout complete.
Updated distraction blocker to a passive icon to reduce clutter.

I first created a low-fidelity homepage wireframe, which focused on showing tasks and habits. After sharing it, I received feedback: Mia suggested simplifying the homepage into a high-level snapshot view and Jeremy noted that the layout felt incomplete and needed clearer hierarchy.

Based on this, I redesigned the wireframe into a dashboard-style layout and then built the high-fidelity prototype. The updated design shows only key habits, tasks, and schedule items, while keeping the interface calm and balanced. I also added Top Task prioritisation scores as suggested, improved spacing, and reduced clutter, which makes the screen easier to scan and act on.

## Reflection  
High-fidelity prototypes help developers by showing exact spacing, styles, and interaction states, which reduces ambiguity during handoff. However, focusing too much on visuals too early can distract from usability testing, so it’s important that I iterated after feedback instead of polishing the wrong direction. Small details like hover states, task priority icons, and progress indicators make the UI more intuitive and guide users smoothly toward focused action.
Creating the high-fidelity prototype helped me understand the importance of visual consistency and interaction details in UX design.  
- I learned how colors, spacing, and typography contribute to usability and branding.  
- I recognized the risk of focusing too much on visuals before validating usability.  

Overall, this task showed me how high-fidelity prototypes not only communicate the final look and feel to stakeholders but also guide developers in building the product accurately.

## Next Steps
Share prototype for further critique in Figma.
Validate design choices with a small usability test before handoff.
Refine animations and transitions to align with Focus Bear’s brand style.
