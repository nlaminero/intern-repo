# UX Design Principles Reflection ‚Äì Focus Bear

## How can Focus Bear maintain a minimal, distraction-free UI while still offering powerful features?
Focus Bear can maintain a clean UI by hiding complexity until it‚Äôs needed. This could mean using collapsible sections, toggles for advanced options, or a simplified default view with a ‚Äúcustomise‚Äù button. Features like routine editing or tracking can be powerful but should be kept out of the way unless the user wants them. Consistent layouts, soft animations, and predictable interactions can help the app feel supportive rather than overwhelming.

## If a design change improves aesthetics but reduces usability, how should UX handle it?
Usability should always come first, especially for neurodivergent users. If a visually cleaner design makes it harder to navigate or understand what to do next, the design should be re-evaluated. UX should communicate the user impact clearly to the team and explore ways to keep the visual improvement without harming clarity.for example, by adjusting spacing, adding tooltips, or improving contrast.

## What are the risks of overloading users with too many choices or settings?
Too many choices can lead to decision fatigue, especially for users with ADHD or autism. They may freeze, get distracted, or feel anxious about picking the ‚Äúright‚Äù option. Focus Bear should reduce cognitive load by offering clear defaults, limited choices, and progressive disclosure (showing more options only when requested). Every setting or feature should have a clear purpose and be introduced with explanation or guidance.

üëâ *Personal Example:* In my redesign of the Focus Bear dashboard, I created a **tabbed layout** where only the current section (Habits, Tasks, Schedule, or Focus) is visible at a time. This prevented the interface from being overloaded with all features at once. I also added a simple snapshot of the morning routine to keep users focused on the immediate next step, with a ‚ÄúView All‚Äù button for those who want more detail.
