# Inclusive Design Reflection 

## How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
I can adjust my communication by being more intentional with clarity, tone, and structure. This means using simple, straightforward language without assuming prior context. For teammates, I try to avoid overwhelming messages by keeping things organized in bullet points or using visual aids when needed. I also check in to make sure my messages are received clearly, and I stay open to repeating or rephrasing things without judgment. It’s important to offer both async and live options for communication, depending on their preference.

## What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
- Using vague language that might confuse or distract neurodivergent users
- Hiding key features like “Edit Habit” under settings instead of making them more accessible
- Not separating routines visually, which can overwhelm users who need predictable layouts
- Too many notifications, emojis, or design elements that compete for attention
- Not providing enough explanation for what a feature does or why it’s needed

## What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
I will design and write with] clarity in mind. This means using consistent layouts, plain language for buttons and instructions, and avoiding “funny” labels that could be misinterpreted.

## Task Activity

### First-Person Insight
I read a blog post by a woman with ADHD who described her frustration with productivity apps that felt “punishing” or overly busy. She mentioned that most tools gave her too many options, didn’t guide her, or made her feel guilty when she fell behind.

**Takeaway:** Neurodivergent users need apps that feel supportive  not judgmental. The app should gently guide, not pressure.

### One Design/Communication Improvement
Add inline editing buttons directly in the Habit section instead of forcing users to go into Settings. This removes extra steps and reduces the chance of confusion or task abandonment.

### Supportive Response Practice

> **User:** “I’ve been trying to follow the routine but I just keep forgetting or zoning out. I feel like I’m failing and the app isn’t helping me.”
>
> **Response:**  
> Hey there! first of all, you’re not failing at all. Everyone has tough days, especially when executive functioning makes things harder. You’re here, you’re trying, and that matters. Focus Bear is designed to support you without judgment, and we’re always working to make it easier. Would it help if we reviewed your current routine together or made the steps more manageable?
