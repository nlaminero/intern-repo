# Design Critique Reflection 

## What is Design Critique and Why is it Crucial?

Design critique is a structured process where designers receive feedback on their work from peers, developers, stakeholders, or users. It is not about liking or disliking a design — it's about evaluating how well the design solves a problem, supports usability, and aligns with user needs.

Critique helps uncover usability issues, strengthen collaboration, and avoid design blind spots. It encourages continuous improvement and helps align designs with research insights and business goals.

## Key Principles of Giving Helpful, Constructive Feedback

- **Be specific:** Focus on particular elements, not general feelings (e.g., "The button is too small for mobile" vs. "This feels off").
- **Stay objective:** Base feedback on usability principles or user goals.
- **Be respectful and supportive:** Aim to improve the design, not attack the designer.
- **Offer alternatives or ask guiding questions:** Instead of just pointing out a flaw, suggest something or ask, “What if we tried X instead?”

## Receiving Critique Gracefully

- **Listen without interrupting.** Take notes instead of reacting immediately.
- **Ask clarifying questions.** If feedback is unclear, say: “Can you explain what made that part confusing?”
- **Separate yourself from the design.** It’s not about you — it's about improving the product.
- **Thank people for their input** and reflect before deciding how to act on it.

## Reflection

**What is the difference between personal opinion and objective UX critique?**  
Personal opinion is subjective and often based on taste (e.g., "I don’t like green"). Objective UX critique is grounded in user needs, accessibility, usability principles, and research findings (e.g., "The green text doesn’t meet color contrast standards").

**If someone gives vague feedback like "I don’t like this", how would you get more useful input?**  
I would follow up with open-ended questions like, “Can you describe what feels off to you?” or “Is it the layout, color, or flow that’s causing that reaction?” This helps guide the person toward actionable insights.

**How can you ensure that design critique sessions are productive rather than overwhelming?**  
- Set a clear agenda and focus area (e.g., “Let’s look at onboarding only today”).
- Limit the number of reviewers to avoid too much conflicting input.
- Use structured formats (like Figma comments or FigJam sticky notes).
- Remind everyone that the goal is to improve the design, not finalize it right away.
