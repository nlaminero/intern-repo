# Data Privacy & Confidentiality Reflection – Focus Bear

## What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?
- Never share user data or internal documents outside of trusted platforms like GitHub or Slack (with proper access control).
- Avoid entering private info into AI tools, Google Docs, or other services unless it’s anonymised or approved.
- Always log out of shared devices and lock my screen when I step away.
- Be mindful of screenshots make sure no sensitive info is visible before sharing anything publicly or in team channels.

## How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
- **Store**: Use encrypted or secure platforms (e.g., Google Drive with proper permissions, Notion with team-only access).
- **Share**: Only share links or files with the right team members always double-check access settings.
- **Dispose**: Delete unused drafts or old files that contain sensitive information, and empty trash from cloud tools. Avoid storing personal info long-term unless it’s necessary.

## What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?
- Sharing screenshots or files with visible email addresses, user IDs, or internal info — avoid this by blurring or cropping before sharing.
- Copy-pasting user feedback or private messages into public tools like AI platforms — always anonymize first.
- Leaving devices unlocked set auto-lock timers and lock manually when stepping away.
- Using weak or reused passwords switch to a password manager and enable 2FA.

## Task Summary

### One habit I will adopt:
**I will review every screenshot or image before sharing to make sure no sensitive data (e.g., usernames, emails, personal routines) is exposed.**

### One key learning I’ll apply:
Confidentiality isn’t just about legal risk it’s about protecting user trust. At Focus Bear, users are already vulnerable (ADHD, ASD), so it’s even more important to respect and protect their privacy by being intentional with how I store and share data.
