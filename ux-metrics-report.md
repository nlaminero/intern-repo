##  Selected UX Metric: **Drop-off Rate in Onboarding**

**Why this metric matters:**  
Onboarding is the first impression of the app. If users drop off early, they may never return. A high drop-off rate signals confusion, lack of value clarity, or overwhelming steps.

## üìà Data Analysis (via PostHog)

- **Current trend:** Drop-off rate during onboarding has remained high (over 40%) across the past month.
- **Where users drop:** Most users exit after setting the first habit or before starting the first focus session.
- **Possible causes:**
  - The onboarding process lacks clear guidance.
  - Too many steps too soon.
  - Users don‚Äôt yet understand how the app benefits them.

## üìù Reflection

### 1. If a UX metric shows poor user engagement, how would you determine the cause?
I'd start by combining **quantitative data** (e.g., click maps, session time, drop-off points) with **qualitative insights** (e.g., user interviews, comments). Watching session recordings can reveal if users are confused, misclicking, or abandoning due to friction.

### 2. What are the risks of relying too much on numbers instead of qualitative feedback?
Numbers don‚Äôt explain *why* a problem happens. You might miss context like emotional friction, unclear copy, or accessibility issues. Relying purely on data can lead to fixing the wrong things or prioritizing surface-level wins.

### 3. How can UX designers use metrics to convince stakeholders?
By connecting metrics to **user impact** and **business outcomes**. For example: ‚ÄúReducing onboarding drop-off by 10% can lead to a 15% increase in active users.‚Äù Data makes the case for investing in usability stronger.
