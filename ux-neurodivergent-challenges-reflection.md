# UX Reflection – Neurodivergent Challenges

## How can Focus Bear’s design choices make tasks easier for neurodivergent users?
Focus Bear is already designed with routines and visual timers, which helps reduce decision fatigue, a common issue for users with ADHD. 
By guiding users step-by-step and using visual progress (like checkmarks and countdowns), the app removes the pressure of figuring out what to do next. 
Its habit routine system simplifies the user’s day, so they don’t have to mentally plan everything. Making the interface calm, clear, and predictable 
can reduce stress and make it easier to focus.

## If a feature is technically useful but cognitively overwhelming, how should it be redesigned?
It should be simplified or broken into smaller steps. For example, if a feature has too many settings hidden in one place (like editing habits only through the Settings page), that can overwhelm or confuse users. Instead, redesign it so it’s more accessible, like adding a small “edit” icon directly inside the Habits screen. This way, the useful feature is still there but easier to access in context without jumping through multiple steps.

## What are some small UX adjustments that can significantly improve user experience for neurodivergent users?
- **Clearer navigation**: Showing tabs like “Morning / Evening routines” instead of hiding them or combining everything in one screen.
- **Inline editing**: Let users edit routines without going deep into settings especially helpful for ADHD users who act quickly and impulsively.
- **Consistent feedback**: Showing clear messages like “Habit saved” or “1 task left” gives users a sense of progress and closure.
- **Reduced visual clutter**: Using more spacing, better contrast, and separating important actions from secondary ones helps users focus without feeling overwhelmed. Reducing overuse of emojis and ensuring to adhere to design heirarchy principles.
