#  Occupational Health & Safety – Laptop Ergonomics Reflection

## What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?
I’ve started using a **laptop stand** to raise my screen closer to eye level, which helps reduce neck strain. I also plan to invest in an **external keyboard and mouse** so I don’t have to reach forward or bend my wrists awkwardly while typing. This small change already makes my desk setup feel more comfortable and focused.

## What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?
- I’m working on **sitting upright** with my back supported, instead of slouching forward.
- I’ve started taking **short breaks every 25–30 minutes** to stretch or walk around.
- I now do quick **posture checks** throughout the day — shoulders relaxed, feet flat on the floor, and elbows at a 90-degree angle.
- I also try to keep my screen at a height where I’m not tilting my head downward.

## How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?
I’ve started using Focus Bear’s **movement break reminders** to prompt me to stretch, breathe, or take a water break. I’ve also placed a small sticky note on the side of my screen that says “check posture” as a quick visual cue. These gentle nudges help me build better habits without disrupting my flow.

## Task Summary

### One workspace change I made:
I added a **laptop stand** to lift my screen to eye level, which has noticeably reduced neck strain and made it easier to focus for longer periods.

### One habit I’m building:
I’m taking **scheduled movement breaks** every 30 minutes using Focus Bear’s built-in break reminders. This helps reduce stiffness and keeps me more mentally refreshed throughout the day.
