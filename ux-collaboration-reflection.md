# UX Collaboration Reflection

## How can UX ensure a smooth handoff between design and development?
UX can ensure a smooth handoff by keeping files well-organized in Figma, using proper naming conventions, and including component specs (e.g. spacing, states, accessibility notes). Using tools like the Inspect panel in Figma or creating a developer handoff page helps reduce confusion. It's also important to jump on calls with devs to walk them through tricky parts and answer questions in real time.

## What challenges might arise when design, dev, and product teams have conflicting priorities?
One common challenge is when the product team wants to move fast, devs are focused on feasibility, and UX is trying to prioritize quality and accessibility. This can lead to rushed designs or skipped features. The best way to handle this is through communication — being clear on the design rationale, understanding dev constraints, and collaborating to find the best compromise that still supports user needs.

## If a developer modifies a UX design due to technical limitations, how should a UX designer respond?
The UX designer should be open and ask why the change was made. Instead of reacting negatively, they should explore whether the new solution still meets the user’s needs or if there’s a better alternative. It helps to be flexible and solution-focused, while also advocating for the core UX goals. Designers and developers should work together to find an option that balances both usability and technical constraints.
