# User Manual – Nina Rae

## About Me
Hi! I’m Nina Rae, I’m a UX designer with a background in IT and a strong interest in accessibility, inclusion, and neurodivergent-friendly design. I’m very passionate about creating intuitive experiences and love working in collaborative, creative environments where feedback is open and honest.

## Communication Style
- I appreciate clear, direct communication that gets to the point, but I’m always open to friendly check-ins too.
- I prefer written communication first (Slack or comments in Figma), especially for feedback or tasks.
- If something is urgent or complex, quick video calls or voice memos work better for me than long emails.
- I might need a little time to process detailed discussions I do better with time to reflect before giving input.

---

## Work Habits
- I’m a structured creative— I love making clean designs, but I also like to map things out with lists, flows, or sketches before jumping into Figma.
- I do my best work when I know the “why” behind a task, not just what needs to be done.
- I’m good at solo focus time, but I also really enjoy bouncing ideas off teammates when exploring design solutions.

## Focus & Productivity
- I focus best when I’m working with study music, a to-do list, and minimal interruptions.
- I often timebox my work using the Pomodoro method to stay on track.

---

## Feedback Preferences
- I like honest feedback, tell me what worked and what didn’t so I can improve quickly.
- If something isn’t working in a design, I prefer clear examples or suggestions instead of vague comments.
- I’m happy to give feedback too  I’ll always aim to be encouraging, constructive, and respectful of your style.

## Quirks & Good to Know
- I like to brainstorm out loud when working through complex ideas, especially in early design stages.
- I really care about making things accessible — I might ask questions like “Will this be okay for someone with ADHD?” often!

---

## What I Need from Teammates
- Clarity about expectations, deadlines, and the “why” behind a task
- Space to focus, but also open channels for async questions
- Trust in the design process even messy sketches help us get to polished results
- Encouragement and space to grow — I’m always looking to improve and learn!
