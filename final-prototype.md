# Wireframing & Prototyping  
## Testing & Iterating on Prototypes  

### Goal  
Learn how to test and refine prototypes based on usability testing and stakeholder feedback.

### Why is this important?  
Even well-designed prototypes need iterations to ensure they meet user needs. Testing allows UX designers to catch usability issues early and improve interactions before development.

## ✅ Alignment with Supervisor Rubric  

- **Time Management** – Delivered updates within agreed timelines, reorganized tasks when priorities shifted.  
- **Communication** – Presented prototype updates professionally and explained feedback to peers clearly.  
- **Networking** <img width="611" height="736" alt="jeremy's feedback " src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4eb86d8-6996-4a4f-8c77-201e766f56c0" />
– Engaged with supervisors/colleagues to validate usability issues.  
- **Learning from Feedback** – Applied supervisor/peer feedback to refine prototypes.  
- **IT Skills & Problem Solving** – Applied Figma tools to address issues and improve interaction design.  
- **Teamwork** – Collaborated with interns and responded to integration needs.  
- **Critical Thinking** – Evaluated which feedback to prioritize, avoiding over-iteration.
