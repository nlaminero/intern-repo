# Wireframing & Prototyping  
## Testing & Iterating on Prototypes  

### Goal  
Learn how to test and refine prototypes based on usability testing and stakeholder feedback.

### Why is this important?  
Even well-designed prototypes need iterations to ensure they meet user needs. Testing allows UX designers to catch usability issues early and improve interactions before development.

## 🛠️ Task  

- **Usability Test Session(s)**  
  - *Date/Time:*  
  - *Tester(s):*  
  - *Method: Figma comments 
  - *Screenshots of feedback:*

- **Findings & Issues Identified**  
*1. Blocking status unclear*
-The lock icon isn’t enough to show whether blocking is active/inactive.
-Needs clearer explanation or status text.

*2. Need for a Help button*
-Missing entry point for user guidance or support.

*3. Navigation (Habits / Todos tabs)*
-Habits tab highlighted twice → possible inconsistency or confusion.
-Todos tab may not be needed (suggested removal from bottom nav).
*4. UI Consistency – Morning Routine & Top Tasks*
*5. Positive feedback:* “This part looks great!” → keep design approach here.
*6. Focus Mode (Start button area)*
-Text field appearance: “This looks like a text field?” → unclear element styling.
*7. Quick Breaks section*
-Request to keep the current UI instead of redesign.
*8. Navigation (Home vs Habits)*
-“Home” may be mislabeled or should link differently (Habits vs Home confusion).

- **Iteration Notes**  
  - *(Document changes made in Figma based on feedback)*
 
 *1. Blocking Status (Lock Icon → Card)*
-Added a green “Blocking ON” badge with lock icon in the header.
-This makes it clear whether blocking is active or inactive (resolves confusion).

*2. Streak Indicator*
-Placed the streak number (7) inside the fire icon.
-Matches gamification expectations and keeps UI compact.

*3. Help Button*
-Added a help icon to the header for quick user guidance.

*4. Navigation Tabs*
-Kept Habits tab consistent.
-Todos tab still visible but flagged for removal in later iterations based on Jeremy’s suggestion.
*5. Focus Mode Section*
-Updated the timer display to look more like a countdown field instead of a text input.
-Retained the “Start” button and session summary below for clarity.
*6. Quick Breaks Section*
-Reverted to the previous UI style as per Jeremy’s request (5 min / 15 min buttons).
-Improved consistency with prior designs.
*7. Bottom Navigation*
-Cleaned up to show Home, Focus, Settings only (Todos removed here).
-Aligns with Jeremy’s request and reduces redundancy.
