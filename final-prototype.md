# Wireframing & Prototyping  
## Testing & Iterating on Prototypes  

### Goal  
Learn how to test and refine prototypes based on usability testing and stakeholder feedback.

### Why is this important?  
Even well-designed prototypes need iterations to ensure they meet user needs. Testing allows UX designers to catch usability issues early and improve interactions before development.

---

## 🔍 Research & Learn  

- **Best practices for testing high-fidelity prototypes**  
  Use clickable flows in Figma and observe natural task completion to catch confusion early.  

- **How to analyze feedback from stakeholders vs. end-users**  
  Stakeholders focus on product goals/feasibility, while end-users focus on clarity and ease of use.  

- **Techniques to prioritize feedback and avoid overdesigning**  
  Apply an impact vs. effort approach: fix high-impact issues first and defer low-impact ones.  

- **How usability testing findings should influence iterations**  
  Translate findings into clear changes; wait for valid data before updating features like Quick Breaks.

## 📝 Reflection  

- **Balancing design vision vs. user feedback**  
  I adapted my lock icon idea into a status card, keeping clarity while aligning with Jeremy’s feedback.  

- **Handling conflicting feedback**  
  I paused Quick Break updates since current data was desktop-only, ensuring changes are evidence-based.  

- **Risks of iterating too much without direction**  
  Too many changes can waste time; I managed scope by pacing updates and aligning with team timelines.

## 🛠️ Task  

- **Usability Test Session(s)**  
  - *Date/Time:*  22-29 September 2025
  - *Tester(s):*  Jeremy
  - *Method: Figma comments 
  - *Screenshots of feedback:*

## Findings & Issues Identified

**1. Blocking status unclear**
-The lock icon isn’t enough to show whether blocking is active/inactive.
-Needs clearer explanation or status text.

**2. Need for a Help button**
-Missing entry point for user guidance or support.

**3. Navigation (Habits / Todos tabs)**
-Habits tab highlighted twice → possible inconsistency or confusion.
-Todos tab may not be needed (suggested removal from bottom nav).

**4. UI Consistency – Morning Routine & Top Tasks**

**5. Positive feedback:**
-“This part looks great!” → keep design approach here.

**6. Focus Mode (Start button area)**
-Text field appearance: “This looks like a text field?” → unclear element styling.

**7. Quick Breaks section**
-Request to keep the current UI instead of redesign.

**8. Navigation (Home vs Habits)**
-“Home” may be mislabeled or should link differently (Habits vs Home confusion).

## Iteration Notes
  
**1. Blocking Status (Lock Icon → Card)**
-Added a green “Blocking ON” badge with lock icon in the header.
-This makes it clear whether blocking is active or inactive (resolves confusion).

**2. Streak Indicator**
-Placed the streak number (7) inside the fire icon.
-Matches gamification expectations and keeps UI compact.

**3. Help Button**
-Added a help icon to the header for quick user guidance.

**4. Navigation Tabs**
-Kept Habits tab consistent.
-Todos tab still visible but flagged for removal in later iterations based on Jeremy’s suggestion.

**5. Focus Mode Section**
-Updated the timer display to look more like a countdown field instead of a text input.
-Retained the “Start” button and session summary below for clarity.

**6. Quick Breaks Section**
-Reverted to the previous UI style as per Jeremy’s request (5 min / 15 min buttons).
-Improved consistency with prior designs.

**7. Bottom Navigation**
-Cleaned up to show Home, Focus, Settings only (Todos removed here).
-Aligns with Jeremy’s request and reduces redundancy.

**8. Quick Breaks**
-I did not make design changes to Quick Breaks yet.
-I presented my proposal in the morning meeting to Jeremy, aiming for his approval before iterating.
-The PostHog data I shared was filtered to desktop, so Jeremy pointed out it isn’t currently relevant to mobile use.
-The team is still troubleshooting filtering to mobile, which means I can’t yet validate Quick Break trends on mobile.
-I do have desktop break data, but since this feature is mobile-first, I’m waiting until data is available before making significant design changes.
