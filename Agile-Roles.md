# Agile Roles Reflection – Focus Bear

## What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?

- **Developers** – Build and implement the features based on user stories, designs, and acceptance criteria.
- **QA (Quality Assurance)** – Test features to ensure they meet requirements, are bug-free, and provide a good user experience.
- **Product Manager (PM)** – Owns the product vision and roadmap, defines priorities, and ensures features align with user needs and business goals.
- **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)** – Facilitates team coordination, ensures work flows smoothly, removes blockers, and runs Agile ceremonies like stand-ups and retrospectives.
- **UX Designer** – Researches user needs, creates wireframes and prototypes, and ensures the design is user-friendly and accessible.
- **Other Roles (Stakeholders, Customer Support, etc.)** – Provide feedback from users, report issues, and help prioritize new features based on real-world use.

## Reflection

### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
I’m a **UX Designer**, and my main role is to make sure the product is intuitive, inclusive, and easy to use — especially for neurodivergent users. I work ahead of developers by researching problems, creating user flows, wireframes, and high-fidelity designs in Figma. I also give feedback during QA and retrospectives, ensuring we stay user-focused.

### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
I work closely with PMs to understand feature priorities and define the user journey. I also collaborate with developers to make sure my designs are feasible and clear. If something changes during implementation, I’m ready to adjust the design or explain its intention. I also support QA by helping spot UX bugs or areas where the user flow could be improved.

## My Role in the Agile Team

I help translate user needs into visual and interactive experiences. I provide Figma designs and documentation that developers use to build features, and I stay involved throughout the sprint to ensure what’s built matches the vision. I also participate in retros and async updates to keep the team aligned.

### Role I frequently collaborate with: Developers

I often work with developers to explain layout spacing, interactions, and accessibility needs. One way I can improve teamwork is by adding more inline documentation inside my Figma files (like naming frames clearly, adding tooltips, or linking flows), and by being available in Slack to answer quick questions without delay.
