## Summary

A usability test was conducted with a participant (Dhenzel) who had no prior experience using Focus Bear. The goal was to observe how a new user completes onboarding and sets up their first habit. The session took place in person on an iPhone. Feedback was captured through real-time notes, screenshots, and screen recordings.

## Observations & User Feedback (Grouped by Theme)

### 1. Onboarding Flow
- Onboarding felt overly long and repetitive.
- No visual indicator of progress or how many steps remained.
- No "Back" button — user felt stuck on questions they wanted to re-read or change.
- Questions like “When do you finish work lately?” felt awkward or too specific.
- focus session timer part of onboarding process.

### 2. UI Clarity
- Some fonts were too small, especially in the habit/task labels.
- Emoji icons in questions seemed interactive but weren’t clickable, causing confusion.
- Buttons lacked strong visual affordance (e.g., low contrast, unclear tap areas).

### 3. Focus Session & Habit Setup
- The Brain Dump feature appeared without clear context and distracted the user.
- Habit list appeared suddenly — user wasn’t sure if setup was complete or not.
- Participant wasn't confident that he had “finished” the setup task correctly.

### 4. Tone & Visual Feedback
- App tone felt too controlling, “like being parented.”
- White loading screen was too intense after having dark mode throughout the onboarding.
- Some wording (e.g., “What can you achieve?”) felt overwhelming right away.
- Emoji bears were visually appealing but it changed language and it was hard to understand. eg. Pirate

## Key Quotes from Dhenzel

- "I thought the emoji was a button."
- "I want to change my emoji to Pirate. wait i dont understand what he is saying, nvm"
- "Wait, I can’t go back? That’s annoying."
- "How many more questions are there? This is kinda dragging."
- "I didn’t even know I was done — it just went to the timer screen."
- "why cant i see the habit i just made?"

## Issues Prioritized for Improvement

| Priority | Issue | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| High | Lack of progress bar and back button in onboarding | Causes frustration and confusion early in flow |
| High | Brain Dump interrupts focus sessions| Misleads user and breaks task momentum |
| Medium | Overwhelming question phrasing | Breaks focus and delays task completion |
| Medium | Fonts and button styles not prominent | Affects usability and accessibility |

---

## Recommendations

- Add a visual progress bar and back button to onboarding.
- Refine onboarding questions to be shorter and easier to process.
- Clarify when onboarding ends and when habit setup begins.
- Improve button affordance and readability through better contrast and size.
- Allow users to change avatar bear without changing language.

## Reflection

The session revealed that minor interface details—like wording and visual indicators—have a major impact on user experience. Dhenzel became increasingly frustrated during onboarding due to lack of progress visibility and unclear transitions. This highlights the importance of clear communication, user-friendly flow, and better tone in onboarding UX design.
